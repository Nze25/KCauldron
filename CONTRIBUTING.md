Contribution Guide
==================
You can make and publish your changes, and even suggest to merge your changes with main codebase of the server.

Installing Dev Environment
--------------------------
 * First of all you need to clone main server code and some other parts, like Forge and Bukkit  
   `git clone --recursive https://gitlab.prok.pw/Prototik/KCauldron.git`
 * Move to `KCauldron` directory  
   `cd KCauldron`
 * Prepare some stuff  
   `./gradlew setupCauldron`
 * For now you need to open project in Eclipse IDE
   * If you haven't Eclipse on your computer - [download and install it](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)  
   * In Eclipse choose File - Import... - General - Existing Projects into Workspace, specify KCauldron/eclipse folder
   * Unmark `Copy projects into workspace` button!
   * Click Finish and start your contributing!
